1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
    The minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is negligible, as we are using a Multi-AZ setup which will switch over to the back-up-AZ automatically.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
    The minimum RTO for a single region outage could be set to around 30min if the company has staff on call 24/7.
    All that needs to be done by the staff is log in and switch the master node to the secondary DB.
    This process may take a few minutes.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
    As the DB will automatically switch over to a second AZ in case the first one fails, we should not lose any data in this case.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
    Even in this case we will not lose a lot of data as the data is more or less instantly replicated to the secondary region.
    If we manage to switch the DB over to the secondary DB, only the data written in the meantime is lost.
