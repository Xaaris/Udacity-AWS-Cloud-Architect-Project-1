1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
    The minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is negligible, as we are using a Multi-AZ setup which will switch over to the back-up-AZ automatically.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
    The minimum RTO for a single region outage could be set to around 30min if the company has staff on call 24/7.
    All that needs to be done by the staff is log in and switch the master node to the secondary DB.
    This process may take a few minutes.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
    As the DB will automatically switch over to a second AZ in case the first one fails, we should not lose any data in this case.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
    Even in this case we will not lose a lot of data as the data is replicated to the secondary region.
    One should keep in mind that this replication is asynchronous and there might be some replication-lag due to high network latency or high amount of traffic that is being replicated.
    This might lead to some amount of data being lost.
